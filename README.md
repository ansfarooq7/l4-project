# Limerick Generation - Level 4 Individual Project
**Ans Farooq, BSc Computing Science, University of Glasgow**

The entire project is contained within a single IPython/Jupyter Notebook `.pynb` file created using `Google Colab` and a supporting `wordFrequency.txt` file.

* The Colab file can be found at: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1FnzTROJ72EbgV73zbhaXrVcX9wT7CY4N?usp=sharing
* Hosted as a Gradio app on HuggingFace Spaces: https://huggingface.co/spaces/ansfarooq7/l4-project

## Description
Recent advances in natural language processing (NLP) have shown incredible promise at generating human-quality language. Poetry presents an additional challenge as it often relies on rhyme and rhythm of language. Factoring these in presents an interesting challenge to new deep learning-based methods. This text-generation project examines the use of transformer-based deep learning methods and the addition of constraints for length, rhyme and rhythm given example words to seed a poem. The interface allows you to produce two cohesive limericks automatically, using two different methods. The results of this project were evaluated through human comparisons.
