# Level 4 Project Meeting Minutes

## Date & Time
Wed 16 Mar 2022, 4:30pm

## Attendees
Jake Lever and Ans Farooq

## Agenda
* Discuss progress with survey
* Not much progress made with dissertation yet due to coursework deadlines

## Suggestions & Plan:
* For the dissertation, starting with just the layout - headings, leave sections blank, fake text and then email to Jake so he can check and send back comments for feedback and headings and structure.

* Feel free to merge chapters, maybe design and implementation, what I'm gonna do vs what I did

* Video presentation, only Jake marks it but the 2nd marker will use it as a quick intro to the project. Just a little 5 min video with slides, overview, goals, how I approached, results

* Topic sentences for writing, good way to plan writing. Just write topic sentences out and then go back and flesh out the paragraphs.

* First step is overall structure, then planning will be topic sentences. Doing this first will save a lot of time as opposed to writing like crazy then realising that the order is wrong.
