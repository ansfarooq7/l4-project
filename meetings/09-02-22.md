# Level 4 Project Meeting Minutes

## Date & Time
Wed 9 Feb 2022, 4:30pm

## Attendees
Jake Lever and Ans Farooq

## Agenda
* Discuss progress with two different generation methods for limericks and plan user survey

## Suggestions:
* Entertaining, coherent english, relevant to topic, fits format of limerick,
Ask for adjective about the output, qualitative analysis of broadly positive, negative, obvious themes, wordcloud,
* Leave option for space for larger comments at the end
* Break down feedback into smaller bite-sized chunks for them, makes analysis at end much easier,
* Interesting things to discuss from results, one is better at one thing, the other better at another, different dimensions
* Run it through with a friend, to see feedback about how it is completing the survey etc, do they understand what to do, anything unclear
* Donâ€™t tell them about the difference between generators, it would bias them.
* Hybrid survey model, pre-generated + generate some themselves.
