# Level 4 Project Meeting Minutes

## Date & Time
Wed 2 Feb 2022, 4:30pm

## Attendees
Jake Lever and Ans Farooq

## Agenda
* Discuss progress so far and plan ahead

## Suggestions:
* Provide a few words of feedback to describe the output of one versus the other, qualitative comparison, “people tend to use words that refer to more formality/encyclopaedia” etc?
* Get people to look at both limericks wiki vs gpt-j side-by-side, ask questions about which you prefer, how relevant to topic, elements of humour?
* Ethics checklist for user study
* For quantitative numbers, likert scale, 1-7 etc, tens of people would be good.
* Purely qualitative questions, fewer than that
* Wiki summaries are always the same, wiki generator will be consistent but might not find topic/wiki page and error out. GPT-J generator won’t have that error problem, it will always have some output, but will be more erratic/random/inconsistent.
