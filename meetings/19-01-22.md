# Level 4 Project Meeting Minutes

## Date & Time
Wed 19 Jan 2022, 4:30pm

## Attendees
Jake Lever and Ans Farooq

## Agenda
* Discuss progress so far and plan for semester 2
* Got demo up and running on a HuggingFace space, using a Gradio web interface
* Going to see if I can get a larger model running on HF space, such as GPT-J
* Made improvements to the generation of the start of the each sentence
* Trying to get the writing to be less formal and more poetic, experimenting with syllables of words and sentences

## Improvement suggestions:
* Experiment with, ignore trying to get it to write on a specific topic, give it examples of limericks or poetic text beforehand, give it a bit of text about a topic and text that is poetic
* Ask gpt-j, write me a poem about cricket, to get poetic language with right content words rather than wikipedia
* Think about evaluations and discussions
* Have people compare wikipedia vs gpt-j prompted limericks etc
* Strong dissertations shine at the end with interesting conclusions and discussions
