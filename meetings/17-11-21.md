# Level 4 Project Meeting Minutes

## Date & Time
Wed 17 Nov 2021, 4:30pm

## Attendees
Jake Lever and Ans Farooq

## Agenda
* Discuss using NLTK cmudict (Natural Language Toolkit: Carnegie Mellon Pronouncing Dictionary) instead of the python pronouncing library and using a filter list for words that don’t have good rhymes

## Potential solutions
* Word frequencies, end in noun? Throw out rare words in the rhyming list by using a list of common words.
* Syllables of lines
* Look at rhythm of the limerick, stressed/unstressed syllables, get how many syllables word has, maybe how it’s pronounced too
