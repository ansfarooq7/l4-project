# Level 4 Project Meeting Minutes

## Date & Time
Wed 10 Nov 2021, 5:00pm (Online)

## Attendees
Jake Lever and Ans Farooq

## Agenda
* Discuss limitations of python rhyming library
* Discuss progress of using a Wikipedia library to get summaries for feeding in as prompts to gpt-2 to then generate whole first line and find rhymes for end word.

## Potential solutions
* Word frequencies/counts for filtering rhyming library words
* Generate the first line a few times until a decent end word, e.g noun, hand-built filters, or word list
* Have a look into improving the rhyme finding, better libraries? Phonetics? Could just filter out words with multiple pronunciations.

## HuggingFace Spaces
* Potentially with huggingface spaces, run larger models (gpt-j), basically run any model huggingface supports on spaces with their compute for free
* Look for beginnerâ€™s tutorial, find out about constraints, see if what you want to do is possible
