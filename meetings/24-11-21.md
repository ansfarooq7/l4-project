## Date & Time

## Attendees
Jake Lever and Ans Farooq

## Agenda
* Discuss results of using word frequency list

## Future improvements:
* Focus on syllables, single line, improvements all round, 
* Generating multiple options, ranking them and picking the best one, run a parser against it, spacey, see if the parser is happy with it, check whether it's cohesive english?
* Quite a bit of refining roberta, fill in the blanks better, playing with GPT-2
* Look at huggingface spaces, use heavier weight models, that are a pain to run on colab.
