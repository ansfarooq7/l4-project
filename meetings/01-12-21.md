## Date & Time

## Attendees
Jake Lever and Ans Farooq

## Agenda
* Discuss fine tuning of RoBERTa and experimenting with rhyming and syllables libraries

## Improvement suggestions:
* Experiment and implement best approaches for syllables and rhymes. 
* Continue trying to fine tune RoBERTa and GPT-2 by experimenting and fine tuning
* Write more poetically, instead of formally, with wikipedia.
* Continue looking at rhythm of the limerick, stressed/unstressed syllables, get how many syllables word has, maybe how itâ€™s pronounced too
* Continue looking at ways to generate multiple options, ranking them and picking the best one, run a parser against it, spacey, see if the parser is happy with it, check whether it's cohesive english?
* Continue looking at huggingface spaces, use heavier weight models, that are a pain to run on colab.
