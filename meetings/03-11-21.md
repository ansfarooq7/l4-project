# Level 4 Project Meeting Minutes

## Date & Time
Wed 3 Nov 2021, 4:30pm (Online)

## Attendees
Jake Lever and Ans Farooq

## Agenda
* Discuss how to get model thinking about topic, as I am slightly confused

## Clarification
* Pick a topic, find a bit of text, atm giving the starting word, but put in block of text before that starting word as the prompt. Currently a manual process, eventually automated. See which model picks it up better, GPT-2 or RoBERTa.

## Considerations
* How do you take the input word/phrase and turn it into a paragraph to feed into the model beforehand? Use wikipedia or another language model(eleuther gpt-j)?

* Could pretrain GPT-2 more on poetry, but for now see if we can get it to work as it is.
