Week-by-week plan for the whole project. Update this as you go along.

## Winter semester

**Week 1**
* Read through project proposals and rank best 8 and enter bids into system

**Week 2**
* Project Guidance live sessions
* Read the project guidance notes
* Initial meeting with supervisor

**Week 3**
* Read papers on text-generation
* Read blog posts to learn about language models, GPT-3, experiment with EleutherAI's GPT-J model.
* Meeting with supervisor

**Week 4**
* Get started with a colab notebook, learn how to use causal language models to generate text, use GPT-2 and learn about top-k and top-p sampling, greedy search and beam search.
* Meeting with supervisor

**Week 5**
* Use a masked language model, like RoBERTa, to fill in blank words in a sentence in between a given starting word and an ending word.
* Meeting with supervisor

**Week 6**
* Combine the masked language model with a causal language model, to generate the starting words of sentences and then fill in the rest until the end rhyming word.
* Create a GitHub repository with project and dissertation template and periodically upload prototypes as Colab notebooks.
* Meeting with supervisor

**Week 7**
* Find a way to get information about a topic and to make the limericks relevant to it. 
* Meeting with supervisor

**Week 8**
* Use a Wikipedia library to find rhyming words to replace the hard-coded starting words and ending rhyming words.
* Meeting with supervisor

**Week 9**
* Use input from the user for the topic instead of predefined topic or predfined starting/ending words.
* Meeting with supervisor

**Week 10**
* Use topic summaries from Wikipedia library as prompts for GPT-2 generation of each line.
* Meeting with supervisor

**Week 11**
* Improve rhyme finding
* Create a word frequency list to filter out uncommon words generated by GPT-2.
* Meeting with supervisor

**Week 12 [PROJECT WEEK]** 
* Replace the *pronouncing* Python library to find rhyming words with NLTK cmudict *(Natural Language Toolkit: Carnegie Mellon Pronouncing Dictionary)*.

**Week 13 [PROJECT WEEK]**
* Repeteadly generate each line in limerick until it generates one with a decent end word - using the word frequency list to filter out rare words that don't have good rhymes.
* Submit status report

## Winter break

## Spring Semester

**Week 14**
* Use a python package with specific optimisations for text generation using GPT-2 rather than directly from HuggingFace Transformers.

**Week 15**
* Find another different method of gathering information about the user's given topic, alongside the Wikipedia summary method.
* Meeting with supervisor

**Week 16**
* Host as Gradio app on HuggingFace Spaces.
* Meeting with supervisor

**Week 17**
* GPT-J doesn't work on HuggingFace Spaces either, switch back to the *aitextgen* Python package's GPT-Neo model as another method of getting informational summaries about user's topic alongside the Wikipedia method.
* Meeting with supervisor

**Week 18**
* Change code so it gives the previusly generated lines as prompts for each subsequent line to be generated with GPT-2. Only give the topic summary as a prompt for the first line.
* Meeting with supervisor

**Week 19**
* Switch back to the text-generation pipeline from HuggingFace Transformers with the pre-trained GPT-2 model, rather than the *aitextgen* Python package.
* Meeting with supervisor

**Week 20**
* Generate 2 limericks, using the two separate methods of getting topic summaries from Wikipedia and GPT-2, which can then be compared to decide which is better.
* Meeting with supervisor

**Week 21**
* Create a survey to compare both methods.
* Meeting with supervisor

**Week 22**
* Fix bugs and finalise code to upload the fourth and final prototype to GitHub and HuggingFace Spaces.
* Meeting with supervisor

**Week 23**
* Begin dissertation
* Meeting with supervisor

**Week 24 [TERM ENDS]**
* Continue work on dissertation

**Week 25**
* Dissertation submission deadline and presentations.
