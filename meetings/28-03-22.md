# Level 4 Project Meeting Minutes

## Date & Time
Mon 28 Mar 2022, 2:30pm

## Attendees
Jake Lever and Ans Farooq

## Agenda
* Discuss progress with dissertation

## Dissertation Suggestions:
* For research hypothesis, mention something like combination of RoBERTA + GPT-2 is good for limericks
* If you squashed all of the sections together, it would almost be like annotating source code or a tutorial of what you did
* Need to split it up so it's at a higher level, abstracting away the finer details of everything and make it easy to understand why everything was done how it was, e.g HuggingFace was the obvious way of doing it but hypothetically there were other ways of doing it

### Background
* For the end of the background section, mention what your question is, where the gap exists etc
* Have a section for opportunities or research hypothesis and wrtie out what you're going to test

### Analysis & Design
* Talk about how you intend to approach the problem, at almost a high level of what you'd be planning in doing
* It's really discussing how you plan to go around seeing if your research hypothesis is really true or not
* Talk about planning your survey, user study, requirements for the system - e.g Needs to be able to take in a subject and output a limerick
* Include a figure overview of limerick being generated, e.g football -> limerick about football

## Implementation
* How did you actually code it, e.g used HuggingFace
* Talk about what issues and limitations exist
* Talk about the problems that were discovered and fixed after you had actually deployed

### Evaluation
* To what degree did you succeed in your goals that you outlined at the end of your background chapter
* e.g Turns out it was a terrible idea, did it work, did it not?
* What worked and what didn't

### Presentation
* Short ~10-12 mins video to summarise your project in a way that would make it accessible to a trained computer scientist who might not be aware of the specific area your project involves.
* You will be assessed on your ability:
    * to summarise the work clearly, coherently, and precisely;
    * to use visual aids effectively;
    * to talk confidently and fluently to an audience.
* It is a high-level, basic overview that will be marked by Jake Lever and used by the 2nd marker as an introduction to the project and help them understand it
* Make slides that show a high-level, step-by-step example of what it looks to like to build up a limerick in the system.
    * Input a topic then fetch information about it from Wikipedia or GPT-2
    * GPT-2 builds first line, and the first words of the 2nd line
    * Find a rhyming word for the 2nd line and use RoBERTa to fill in the words between the GPT-2 generated starting words and the end rhyming word, etc. until whole limerick is generated
* Get more into the 'why' and 'what' at the start and maybe discuss a little bit about the survey results.
